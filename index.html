  About us
</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    Far beyond the misty mountains, in a quiet corner of the South East,
    there is a land of silicon and startups... The Thames Valley is home
    to a huge and growing community of web developers and tech startups.
  </p>
  <p>
    WDOTS is here to bring together innovative developers, heroic testers
    and pioneering founders on a quest to make the world a better place.
  </p>
  <p>
    We host monthly events ranging from lightning talks and presentations
    to hacks and project inceptions.
  </p>
  <p>
    So join us for an evening of discussion, code and the occasional moment
    of brilliance over a mead and a bit of pipe weed once every month in
    and around Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.
